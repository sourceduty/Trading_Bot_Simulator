Scenario Setup

1. Stock: ABC Corp
2. Current Price: $100 per share
3. Buyer Bot:
   - Strategy: Moving Average Crossover
   - Criteria: Buy when the short-term moving average (SMA 5) crosses above the long-term moving average (SMA 20).
   - Budget: $10,000

4. Seller Bot:
   - Strategy: Relative Strength Index (RSI)
   - Criteria: Sell when RSI is above 70 (indicating the stock is overbought).
   - Shares Owned: 200 shares

Step-by-Step Simulation

Step 1: Market Data Analysis

The bots analyze the latest market data to make their decisions.

- Buyer Bot Analysis:
  - SMA 5 (Short-Term Moving Average): $98
  - SMA 20 (Long-Term Moving Average): $100
  - Decision: No action (SMA 5 is below SMA 20).

- Seller Bot Analysis:
  - RSI: 72
  - Decision: Sell (RSI is above 70).

Step 2: Order Placement

Since the Buyer Bot decides not to take any action, it does not place an order. However, the Seller Bot decides to place a sell order.

- Seller Bot:
  - Sell Order: 100 shares at $100 each.

Step 3: Order Execution

The market processes the sell order. For the sake of this simulation, we'll assume there's a willing buyer in the market (not the Buyer Bot since it didn't place a buy order).

- Executed Trade:
  - Sold: 100 shares of ABC Corp
  - Price: $100 per share
  - Total: $10,000

Step 4: Update Positions

- Seller Bot:
  - Remaining Shares: 100 shares
  - Cash: $10,000 from the sale.

- Buyer Bot:
  - No change in position (still has a $10,000 budget).

Summary

- Buyer Bot:
  - Strategy: Moving Average Crossover (did not execute a trade as conditions were not met).
  - Current Budget: $10,000

- Seller Bot:
  - Strategy: RSI (executed a trade as conditions were met).
  - Current Shares: 100 shares of ABC Corp
  - Current Cash: $10,000
